# How to share a folder from Windows OS in VMOracle Ubuntu OS
# First I created a folder for which I wanted to share files from my windows host machine
C:\Users\Aboyade Kehinde\VirtualBox VMs\VM_Share
# The folder name is VM_Share and saved an image file.

# Next, I created a folder in my VM machine for which I wanted to access my files from Windows  OS machine
cd ~
mkdir guest_share

# To enable sharing, On my VirtualMachine Ubuntu OS, I went menu tab
Devices -> Shared Folder -> Shared Folder Settings.
# I added a new folder path I created: C:\Users\Aboyade Kehinde\VirtualBox VMs\VM_Share 
# I added the folder name VM_Share, checked the auto mount option and added the mounting point /mnt
# On my terminal in VMOracle Ubuntu, I run the command 

sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions.iso

# The .iso file with an image of the OSE edition of the guest additions CD will install in the host directory 
/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso. 
# Mount this .iso file as a CD in your virtual machine's settings. In the guest you will then have access to a CD-ROM with the installer.
# To do this

sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
cd /mnt
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

reboot

# After VMOracle Ubuntu rebooted,
I run the command

sudo mount -t vboxsf VM_Share guest_share

# Then I changed to the directory guest_share
cd guest_share
ls

# I was able to see my image file I saved :)
# Voila :)
